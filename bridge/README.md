A Matrix bridge for LINE Messenger using mautrix-go.\
Based on the [mautrix-twilio](https://github.com/mautrix/twilio) bridge

> [!WARNING]
> When updating from a version released before February 14, 2026,
> please make sure to reset your configuration and log in again.\
> This is due to a change in the login flow that requires users to log
> in again to fetch the necessary keys for E2EE decryption.

## Known issues

> [!NOTE]
> Messages sent to the LINE Bot using Beeper Desktop may appear as
> indefinitely sending.\
> Use Beeper Mobile to send commands to the LINE Bot account after
> creating the chat with Beeper Desktop.

> [!WARNING]
> The bridge identifies itself as a LINE Chrome Extension client. LINE
> only allows one active Chrome Extension session at a time, so you
> cannot use the LINE Chrome Extension and the bridge simultaneously.
> Logging into the LINE Chrome Extension will invalidate the bridge's
> session (and vice versa). If this happens, you will need to
> re-authenticate the bridge. If you want to use LINE Chrome, you will
> need to log out of the bridge first as the bridge will try to automatically
> log back in and invalidate the LINE Chrome session again.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/highesttt/matrix-line-messenger.git
cd matrix-line-messenger
mkdir data
```

### 2. Choose your setup

---

## Beeper users (Docker)

### Beeper Docker prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [bbctl](https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager) (compile from source if you don't have it):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager.git
cd bridge-manager
./build.sh
```

### Beeper Docker configuration

```bash
bbctl c --type bridgev2 sh-line > data/config.yaml
```

The Docker container will automatically generate a matching
`registration.yaml` from the Beeper-issued tokens in your config on
first startup.

### Beeper Docker run

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

---

## Self-hosted Matrix server (Docker)

### Self-hosted Docker prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A Matrix homeserver (Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit, etc.)

### Self-hosted Docker configuration

Start the container once to generate the example config:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The container will create `data/config.yaml` and exit. Edit it and set:

- `homeserver.address` — your Matrix server URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8008`)
- `homeserver.domain` — your Matrix server domain (e.g. `your.domain.com`)
- `database.uri` — your database URI (e.g. `postgres://user:pass@host/db`)
- `bridge.permissions` — who can use the bridge

Start the container again to generate the registration file:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

It will create `data/registration.yaml` and exit. Register the
appservice with your homeserver by adding the registration file path to
your homeserver config. For Synapse, add it to
`app_service_config_files` in `homeserver.yaml`, then restart the
homeserver.

### Self-hosted Docker run

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

To run without rebuilding on subsequent starts:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Native on Windows (without Docker)

### Windows prerequisites

- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with mingw-w64 toolchain:

```bash
winget install MSYS2.MSYS2
# Open MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal and install packages:
pacman -Syu mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc cmake
```

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [olm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm) library:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm.git
cd olm
cmake -Bbuild -G "Unix Makefiles" \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw64
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
cd ..
```

- If using Beeper, compile [bbctl](https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager) from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager.git
cd bridge-manager

# Windows only: In cmd/bbctl/run.go, remove the following lines
# because MSYS2 is still seen as Linux, but Windows doesn't support Setpgid:
#
#   if runtime.GOOS == "linux" {
#       cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{
#           Setpgid: true,
#       }
#   }

./build.sh
```

### Windows build

Copy the olm `.dll` and `.dll.a` files to the project root, then:

```bash
./build-windows.sh
```

### Windows configuration

**Beeper users:**

```bash
bbctl c --type bridgev2 sh-line > data/config.yaml
bbctl r sh-line > data/registration.yaml
```

**Self-hosted Matrix server:**

```bash
./matrix-line.exe -e -c data/config.yaml
# Edit data/config.yaml and set:
#   homeserver.address: http://localhost:8008  (your Matrix server URL)
#   homeserver.domain: your.domain.com         (your Matrix server domain)
#   database.uri: sqlite:///data/matrix-line.db  (or a postgres URI)
#   bridge.permissions: (who can use the bridge)

./matrix-line.exe -g -c data/config.yaml -r data/registration.yaml
# Register the appservice with your homeserver
```

### Windows run

```bash
cd data
../matrix-line.exe
```

---

## Native on Linux / macOS (without Docker)

### Linux / macOS prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) and build tools (`gcc`, `make`)
- [olm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm) library (install via your package manager or build from source)
- If using Beeper, compile [bbctl](https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager) from source

### Linux / macOS build

```bash
./build.sh
```

### Linux / macOS configuration

**Beeper users:**

```bash
bbctl c --type bridgev2 sh-line > data/config.yaml
bbctl r sh-line > data/registration.yaml
```

**Self-hosted Matrix server:**

```bash
./matrix-line -e -c data/config.yaml
# Edit data/config.yaml and set:
#   homeserver.address: http://localhost:8008  (your Matrix server URL)
#   homeserver.domain: your.domain.com         (your Matrix server domain)
#   database.uri: sqlite:///data/matrix-line.db  (or a postgres URI)
#   bridge.permissions: (who can use the bridge)

./matrix-line -g -c data/config.yaml -r data/registration.yaml
# Register the appservice with your homeserver
```

### Linux / macOS run

```bash
cd data
../matrix-line
```

## Login

### Via Beeper Desktop Settings

1. Open Beeper Desktop Settings
2. Navigate to `Bridges`
3. Click the three dots next to your LINE Bridge and select
   `Experimental: Add an account`
4. Follow the instructions to log in to your LINE account.

### Using the Bridge Bot (any Matrix client)

1. Open your Matrix client and start a chat with
   `@sh-linebot:your.matrix.homeserver.domain`.\
   For Beeper, use `@sh-linebot:beeper.local`.
2. Send the command `login` and follow the instructions.

## Can't log in?

There are two common reasons login can fail:

### 1. No email is set on your LINE account

This bridge uses the email from your account information. If your
account is older, you signed in using a phone number, or you signed in
with Google, you may not have an email set for your LINE account.

**How to set an email for your LINE account:**

1. Open the LINE app on your mobile device.
2. Go to `Settings` > `Account`.
3. Tap on `Email address` and set your email address.

### 2. Letter Sealing (End-to-End Encryption)

The bridge supports both `Letter Sealing` ON and OFF accounts. Messages
to peers or groups without `Letter Sealing` are sent as plain text
automatically.

For details on how the bridge handles different Letter Sealing
combinations, see [readme/LETTER_SEALING.md](readme/LETTER_SEALING.md).
